A newly opened interactive Community Science Museum website with the goal of leading futute visitors into booking tickets to visit the museum - created in context of Front-end Development study programme at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media.

## Description

A Science Museum recently opened with a diverse range of interactive exhibits for a core target audience that is inquisitive and intelligent primary and middle school children (ages between 7-15) and families with young children. The website is aimed to be informative and appealing. All exhibits were a criation for this project.
Developed as my Semester Project as a student of Front-end Development at Noroff, this online store is meant to inform and appeal its users into booking tickets for the museum. It has a simple, clear and easy flow for a better user experience. At this point we were not yet using Javascript at the course.
